## 🌟 Overview

**BucketStack** is a modern, native desktop application that provides a beautiful, macOS-style interface for managing S3-compatible object storage. Built with **Tauri**, **React**, and **Rust**, it combines the power of cloud storage with the elegance of native desktop applications.

### ✨ Key Highlights

- 🎨 **Native Design**: Seamlessly integrates with macOS, Windows, and Linux design languages
- 🔐 **Military-Grade Security**: Zero plaintext credential storage with machine-bound secure storage (AES-256-GCM encrypted)
- 🚀 **Blazing Fast**: Native performance with Rust backend
- 📱 **System Tray Integration**: Quick access via system tray (macOS menu bar, Windows system tray)
- 🌙 **Dark/Light Themes**: Automatic theme switching with system preferences
- 📁 **Advanced File Operations**: Upload, download, copy, move, compress, and more
- ☁️ **Multi-Provider**: Works with AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, Wasabi, Backblaze B2, and any S3-compatible service

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Rust** (latest stable) - [Install](https://rustup.rs/)
- **System Requirements**:
  - macOS 10.15+ / Windows 10+ / Linux (glibc 2.28+)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SaiAkashNeela/bucketstack.git
   cd bucketstack
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Using pnpm (recommended)
   pnpm install
   
   # Or using npm
   npm install
   
   # Or using bun
   bun install
   ```

3. **Run in development mode**
   ```bash
   pnpm run tauri:dev
   # or
   npm run tauri:dev
   # or
   bun run tauri:dev
   ```

### Building for Production

**All platforms build automatically via GitHub Actions CI** when a version tag is pushed:

```bash
git tag v1.0.3
git push origin refs/tags/v1.0.3
```

This triggers the release workflow which builds Windows, Linux, and macOS (universal binary) in parallel, signs and notarizes the macOS build, publishes the GitHub release, and auto-bumps the version for the next release.

**macOS local build** (signed, not notarized):
```bash
./scripts/build.sh     # Build and sign
./scripts/notarize.sh  # Notarize and create DMG
```
